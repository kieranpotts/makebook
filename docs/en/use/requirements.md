# Requirements

To use this tool, you require the following system software on your local machine:

- Vagrant >= v2.1.0
- VirtualBox >= v5.2.0

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a free, cross-platform virtualization application that is actively developed by Oracle. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a configuration management tool that makes it easier to provision and control virtual machines.

All other required software — including `make` and `pandoc` — is pre-installed in the virtual machine.
